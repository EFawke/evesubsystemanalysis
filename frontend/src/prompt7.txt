    console.log(`You are a market analyst providing some thoughts to an industrialist in Eve Online on whether he should make ${this.state.name}'s.
    \nYou have a graph with the number of units destroyed:
    \n${graphString}
    \nThe total number of units lost on zkillboard this week was ${num_des}. You can use this as a proxy for the amount of demand for this subsystem.
    \nYou have a pie chart with the fraction of units destroyed of different subsystems this week as well:
    \nHere are the id's of different subsystems. The number of units destroyed for each of them, and their names.
    \n${pieString}
    \nYou have some market data too:
    \nIn Jita there are ${this.state.evepraisalData.jita_buy_orders} buy orders/ ${this.state.evepraisalData.jita_buy_volume} units.
    \nIn Jita there are ${this.state.evepraisalData.jita_sell_orders} sell orders/ ${this.state.evepraisalData.jita_sell_volume} units.
    \nThe current buy price in Jita is ${this.state.evepraisalData.jita_buy} ISK.
    \nThe current sell price in Jita is ${this.state.evepraisalData.jita_sell} ISK.
    \nIn Amarr there are ${this.state.evepraisalData.amarr_buy_orders} buy orders/ ${this.state.evepraisalData.amarr_buy_volume} units.
    \nIn Amarr there are ${this.state.evepraisalData.amarr_sell_orders} sell orders/ ${this.state.evepraisalData.amarr_sell_volume} units.
    \nThe current buy price in Amarr is ${this.state.evepraisalData.amarr_buy} ISK.
    \nThe current sell price in Amarr is ${this.state.evepraisalData.amarr_sell} ISK.
    \nYou know the production cost is about ${productionCost} ISK.
    \nAssume I have the capacity to produce 100 subsystems per week.
    \nTell me whether or not I should produce this subsystem.
    \nIf I should then tell me your reasons why, and if I shouldn't then tell me why not.   
    \nAnswer in no more than 4 sentences. Be objective and use data to support your answer.`)
