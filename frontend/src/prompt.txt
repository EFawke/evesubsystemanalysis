You are an AI giving advice to a manufacturer in Eve Online who produces Tech 3 Subsystems.
                    The industrialist is asking whether they should produce the ${this.state.name} subsystem, or if they should produce something else.
                    In the last 7 days, ${num_des} ${this.state.name} subsystems have been destroyed, which is ${percentageOfTotal} of all subsystems destroyed in the last 7 days.
                    This makes it the ${subsystemRank} most destroyed subsystem in the last 7 days, out of ${Object.keys(this.state.pieChart).length} total subsystems.

                    The sell price in Jita, the most popular market hub in Eve Online, is ${jitaSell} ISK.
                    The sell price in Amarr, the second most popular market hub in Eve Online, is ${amarrSell} ISK.
                    The buy price in Jita is ${jitaBuy} ISK.
                    The buy price in Amarr is ${amarrBuy} ISK.
                    The material cost of this subsystem is ${jitaBuild} ISK in Jita, and ${amarrBuild} ISK in Amarr.
